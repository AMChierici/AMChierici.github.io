excerpt: 'Time-offset interaction applications (TOIAs) are new narrative-sharing that simulate face-to-face interactions between humans and previously-recorded videos of other humans. In this dissertation, we explore the next evolution of TOIAs, designing and developing a system ideal for mass adoption while catering to individuals with differing interests, languages, and cultures. Our research expands on previous work by addressing the lack of a streamlined methodology for creating and evaluating TOIAs.'

Time-offset interaction applications (TOIAs) are new narrative-sharing that simulate face-to-face interactions between humans and previously-recorded videos of other humans. In this dissertation, we explore the next evolution of TOIAs, designing and developing a system ideal for mass adoption while catering to individuals with differing interests, languages, and cultures. Our research expands on previous work by addressing the lack of a streamlined methodology for creating and evaluating TOIAs.

Here we show that a framework and smart software features for high-quality prerecordings, seamless interactions between users and TOIAs, and an evaluation framework for TOIAs can effectively create good-quality interactions with limited timeframes and resources. Our contributions include an openly sourced TOIA, a library of prerecordings and corpora, a methodology for developing the dialogue manager, evaluation methodologies, two extensive Human-Computing Interaction (HCI) user studies, and guidelines for developing TOIA's interfaces. The potential of TOIAs to bridge the gap between recorded narratives and face-to-face interactions has implications for fields beyond narrative-sharing technology, such as education, therapy, and cross-cultural communication. As such, the research presented in this dissertation contributes to a growing body of work exploring the intersection of technology, storytelling, and human interaction.

The development of TOIAs can revolutionize how we interact with recorded narratives and stories. Our methodology and tools can be applied in various contexts, making this research significant for preserving cultural heritage and developing personalized and interactive storytelling. TOIAs will provide a platform for preserving cross-cultural narratives while fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives.
