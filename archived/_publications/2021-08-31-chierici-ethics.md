excerpt: 'How often have you heard that we must fear an AI-driven apocalypse? That one day the robots will take over? That we will lose our freedoms and follow the leadership of a ruthlessly efficient overlord? This is what we hear on a daily basis, but is there any truth to those claims? The Ethics of AI: Facts, Fictions and Forecasts seeks to explore those questions, and brings in the research of experts such as moral philosopher and author Jonathan Haidt, former lead of psychology at Cambridge Analytica Patrick Fagan and Charles Radclyffe, founder and CEO of the first rating agency for ESG/Ethical AI. Each chapter explores the fundamental aspects of AI and their history, challenging your perspectives on what AI is, and could become. We must keep pace with the rapid development of technology, placing morality and ethics at the forefront when scoping the development of AI applications.'
