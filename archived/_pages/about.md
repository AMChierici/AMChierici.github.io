Hello and welcome! I'm Dr. Alberto Chierici, a polymath with a unique blend of expertise in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, entrepreneurship, product and venture building. My diverse interests converge on a singular mission: the pursuit of beauty and authenticity through the synergy of science and humanities.

My Journey: From Physics to AI, Entrepreneurship, and Beyond
======
I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), where I was also a part of the esteemed [CAMeL Lab](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/computational-approaches-to-modeling-language-lab.html). My academic journey began with a degree in Physics, followed by a Master's in Statistics. 

I kicked off my professional life as an actuary, but my insatiable curiosity led me to pivot into consulting. There, I honed my skills in building and managing Machine Learning products for enterprise clients. Along the way, I founded and helped found several companiesâ€”each an invaluable lesson in management, team dynamics, customer relations, and product development. I had a short-lived stint back in the corporate world, trying to push the boundaries of insurance innovation at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com). I worked on a project that was sold to me as "revolutionary" and watched it fail miserably for silly reasonsâ€”we were an amazing team, and we tried really hard to make it succeed, and we gained many invaluable learnings on dysfunctional management and innovator's dilemma. Plus, lots of funny stories to tell if you're interested! ðŸ˜„

Currently, I'm carrying on research on AI and Dialogue Systems at New York University Abu Dhabi and supporting cool projects in various capacities (advisor, investor, hands-on company building) at [Around](https://www.around.to) and [ARK](https://ark.ninety.com/).  

Author of "The Ethics of AI: Facts, Fictions, and Forecasts"
======
Concerned about the unchecked faith humanity places in technology and AI, I penned the book [_The Ethics of AI: Facts, Fictions, and Forecasts_](https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-AI-Facts-Fictions-Forecasts-ebook/dp/B09DFBRFCR). It's a must-read for anyone interested in the ethical implications of artificial intelligence.
